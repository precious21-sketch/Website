   <h1>You only Live Once- By Nadia</h1>
   <p> 
    I'm naturally a pretty active and loud person when I'm around friends and people 
    I like,which is at 
    school. To me school was always quite annoying and I didn't have motivation,but it was manageable and
    the good outweighed the bad things,but since I entered my new grade it's been quite different.
    Right now going to school is a hard task every single day. It is exhausting and draining. You know 
    how for most people the weekend is refreshing and they get to rest and take a short break from 
    school? I don't look forward to the weekend. It's still as stressful and exhausting just a bit less.
    I feel like school doesn't make me temporarily tired anymore. It's permanently making me exhausted 
    and takes more and more of my motivation away. So now I don't even feel like the normal person I 
    used to be, all funny and weird.<br>The exhaustion is taking a permanent toll on my personality and the
    only thing keeping me together is God and my Spotify playlist. It's kind of gotten to the point where
    I don't really mind switching schools and leaving my friends anymore even though I love all of them only
    for everything to become easier and for me to become my real person again. And the thing is I basically 
    only see my friends in school and can't even hang out with them. So my entire life is school to be honest.
    Then when I try to take a break by doing something I find relaxing I relax for too long and procrastinate
    all my work so it's really a cycle of stress, and fatigue to temporary relaxation and back again.
    
    I feel like in order for me to go back to normal I need a long break from my environment. This means a break from where I am, school and so on.</p>
