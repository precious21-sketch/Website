   <h1>My Strange Life- By: Olivia Aiku</h1>
   <p> Dear Diary,
Today was a Tuesday. I hate Tuesdays. You would think that Mondays would be my least favourite, but 
 Tuesdays are even worse. On Monday you can at least come to school well rested from the weekend, but
on Tuesday you're tired, full of homework, and the schedule is absolutely ridiculous. So I show up to 
school, and my friend is already telling me about all the homework she has and how she doesn't think 
she'll be able to finish it all, which reminds me of all my homework. First period was chem. We're 
learning organic chemistry, and I lowkey get it, but highkey don't, I mean it makes sense, but at same time it doesn't. Idk how to explain it.
All the other lessons were kinda boring, except math. I have math with some of my friends, and it's so 
fun, cuz I also understand most of the things we do, so its a win win situation.</p> 
<p>Anyway, I come from school and I'm so exhausted, I eat some lunch, and get back to work. Hopefully 
today I'll finish all my assignments. Goodbye Diary, until we meet again... (Literally tomorrow why am I so dramatic??)</p>
