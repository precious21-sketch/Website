   <h1>Ups and downs-By:Leila Sanders</h1>
   <p> My life has been a rollercoaster ever since I was born. Ever since I was young, I always knew I 
 was different. I was termed as an 'old soul' , a 'stickler to the rules', a 'softie'. I was called a
lot of things based on the things that I believed at a young age. Then came adolescence. Adolescence,
adolescence, adolescence. When I became a teenager, I believed in the same things, I still do. I think 
that there's no point in drinking, smoking, and partying. I find those things useless. I think that the 
school system is doing too much but I will still never let my grades fall below average, and I thought 
that I would enter and leave my teenage years the same. With the same smile on my face and the same way 
of thinking. Oh how I was wrong. These days, I don't smile much, I don't laugh the way I used to, I don't
have the same ambition. I used to dream so big. So so big. Dreaming of becoming someone great but now I
dream about making it until the next day. School. School. School. School. School was my haven, my resting 
place, the place where I thought I would make memories. I never thought that school would be a place I 
would come to dread, a place I couldn't wait to get out of. Some days are good. I laugh, I smile, I feel 
fine. But I think ever since becoming a teenager, I have just been on a roller coaster of emotions with 
no landing place. At times, I'm happy, other days I'm sad, but most days I'm lost and stressed out of my 
mind.</p>
<p> My memory used to be top notch but now I forget a lot. I'm told to do something one minute and I 
forget it the next. I used to be top of my class but ever since becoming a teenager things have been off.
So off. I really wonder what happened. I think that being a teenager going to school is an experience.
An experience I will never forget because you learn things and you lose things. You realize that toxic 
friends aren't worth it, you realize that school only goes downhill from here and that there's nothing 
you can do about it and you realize that everyone fends for themselves and nobody else.</p>
<p>I remember thinking as a kid that teenagers were overreacting when they said that they were 
 misunderstood. Now I can't help but think how wrong I was. I really hope that the rest of my teenage
 years are better than this. If they aren't, at least I know I'll come out on the other side.
