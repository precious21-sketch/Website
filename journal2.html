   <h1>The Highschool Stuggle- By Renato Teixeria</h1>
   <p> As an IB MYP Grade 10 student, life can sometimes feel like a juggling act. Between managing 
multiple deadlines, making progress on my Personal Project, and preparing for e-assessments, everyday 
presents a challenge. Staying organized and motivated isn't always easy, but it’s teaching me a lot 
about resilience and time management. This past week has been particularly intense. My Personal Project 
deadline is looming, and I’ve been working hard to finalize my product while making sure my report meets
the assessment criteria. On top of that, teachers are assigning review tasks in preparation for our 
e-assessments. Balancing both feels overwhelming at times, especially when I also want to maintain some 
personal time for rest and hobbies. To stay on top of everything, I’ve been using a planner to break my 
tasks into manageable chunks. I set specific goals for each day, such as drafting one part of my Personal 
Project report or reviewing one topic for science. This method has helped reduce stress and made my workload
seem less daunting. <br> However, it’s not always smooth sailing. There are moments when procrastination
gets the better of me, or when unexpected tasks throw off my schedule. Learning to adapt and stay 
flexible is crucial. I’ve also realized the importance of asking for help when I need it—whether it's 
clarifying project requirements with a teacher or studying with friends for e-assessments.
Managing deadlines, the Personal Project, and e-assessments all at once is challenging, but it’s shaping 
me into a more disciplined and resourceful learner. I’m learning how to prioritize, manage stress, and 
take ownership of my learning journey. While it’s tough, I know these experiences are preparing me for 
even greater challenges in the future. For now, I’ll keep pushing forward—one task at a time.</p>
