   <h1>My Experience at GHA- By Keshia</h1>
   <p> Coming to GHA was probably the worst and best thing that has ever happened to me till date, I hold
 regrets and sometimes I wish I could change them but oh well life has a funny way on making you reflect. 
 Joining this establishment in grade 9, I was excited and the funny thing that happened is that three weeks
in, that excitement turned to nothing but pure boredom. The first year was wonderful, I made friends, 
started a few tiffs with people I still don't know till date but all ended well for that year. I'm generally 
amused to this day at the amount of petty things that happen daily due to immaturity. I did happen to face
a lot of problems with people because I'm anxious and too much of a recluse. I have a certain discomfort
with crowded places and I hate noise. So I had a hard time adjusting since I was used to small close knit schools. Grade 10, of course started quite nicely but it didn't last long as time 
went on I became emotionally distant because of the stress with my grades, deadlines and trying to Keep 
my relationships intact. I'd be lying if I said I'm any better now it's only gotten worse with having my 
own personal issues on top. <br>
My journey in this school has been a whirlwind of events, emotions, arguments and heartwarming memories 
made all together as I learned to cherish all the good and bad memories regardless of how they made me 
feel. </p>
