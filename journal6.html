   <h1>By Sandra Oman</h1>
   <p> You become a teenager when the number of your age has a teen at the end and you stop when the 
teen goes away, so thirteen to nineteen. I recently turned 16 and have spent all my teenage years at my
 current school. The older I grow the more I realize how young I once was, in both a positive and 
 negative way. On one side I can see how much I have learned and improved a year and on the other, I can
see all the things I could have done differently or things I should have put more emphasis on. For 
example, I am currently going through a mini-crisis of what I want to become in the future, I know I 
want to be in the medical field but I am not so sure where, a few years ago I wanted to be a doctor, 
then I wanted to be medical scientist, now I am thinking about neurosurgeon. I hate the feeling of not
knowing what I want to become it makes me feel unorganized and that I have no sense of direction for my 
future. </p>
<p>I was filling out a form a few days ago and there was somewhere that asked me what I wanted to be
in the future and what university options I had, I had been thinking about these things but writing it 
down I felt unsure in the sense that I had not done in-depth research and considered so many side factors 
like tuition, acceptance, application procedure and so on. I have a small confession and that I used to 
look down on people who when I asked them what they wanted to become in the future would say they did not
know, today I stand somewhere near them, I wish I could apologize to them even though I never said I
 judged them to their face. The only thing I can do now I make sure that whatever I do, I do it towards 
 success to ensure that at least when I am sure of what I want to become in the future, I have a good 
 portfolio to support me.. </p>
